This is a test post writen in markdown and parsed into HTML by [Redcarpet 2](http://github.com/vmg/redcarpet).  To learn more about markdown check out the [documentation](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) on [Daring Fireball](http://daringfireball.net/).  

### Code
Here is some inline code, `Face f = v.faces[0];`, and a code block:

``` java
void removeFace(int n) {
  // link controlp5 removeFace button to the function
  manifold.removeFace(manifold.faces()[0]);
}
```

The block above uses [Pygments](http://pygments.org) for syntax highlighting. Neat.



### Maths
Here is some inline math: \\(e^x\\).  What about display math?  
\\[a + b = x\\]


Awesome.
