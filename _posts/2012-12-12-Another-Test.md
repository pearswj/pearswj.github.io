Blackquotes are a great way of, well, quoting source material:

> The Exhibition Centre at the new Cairo Expo City development comprises a curved roof structure sweeping over four internal exhibition halls and covering over 180 000m^2 of plan area. This project has been driven by the design team’s desire for complete integration of structure and architecture while efficiently realising a complex free-form shape. This paper presents the technical and logistical development of the roof structure, integration with architecture, operation and servicing, and the structural design and optimisation of the spatial roof truss.
